# Python coding practices

Python version: 3.9

Py file name consists of two parts - "category_feature.py". For example, "datatype_bytearray.py" is about bytearray of datatype.

Each practice file can be executed independently.

Most test results are validated by using assert statement, so you can see the expected result without running it. This can save time if you only need a quick review.
